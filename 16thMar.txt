1) AI - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that 
typically require human intelligence. For example, speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning.

ML - Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes 
without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. For example, consider
the recommender sytems which is used by netflix or amazon to recommend thier users movies or products they prefer.

DL - Algorithms based on highly complex neural networks that mimic the way a human brain works to detect patterns in large unstructured data sets. For example, 
deep learning is commonly used in image classification tasks like facial recognition.


2) In Supervised Learning, the machine learns under supervision. It contains a model that is able to predict with the help of a labeled dataset. A labeled dataset is 
one where you already know the target answer. For example, Supervised learning is used to assess the risk in financial services or insurance domains in order to 
minimize the risk portfolio of the companies.

3) In Unsupervised Learning, the machine uses unlabeled data and learns on itself without any supervision. The machine tries to find a pattern in the unlabeled 
data and gives a response. For example, Customer segmetation

4) ðŸ”¹Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to think by understanding, learning from the data, and taking decisions based on patterns hidden in the data or 
make inferences that would otherwise be very difficult for humans to make manually. The end goal of using ML or DL is to create an AI application or machine as 
smart as humans.

ðŸ”¹Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI; it provides us statistical tools/techniques like Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement learning to explore and 
analyze the data.

ðŸ”¹Deep Learning (DL) is further a subset of ML, and the main idea behind it is to make machines learn by mimicking the human brain. Here, we create a multi 
neural network architecture with the help of different techniques like ANN, CNN, and RNN.

ðŸ”¹Data Science (DS) is basically drawing insights from structured and unstructured data either by using ML or DL or without these techniques. We can even use 
different visualization tools, statistics, and probability to gain these insights.

5) Supervised Learning - Here you know the output feature of this dataset. You know what you wanna predict.
Unsupervised Learning - Here we do not know nay specific output instead we try to group them into similar data to better understand them.
Semi-supervised Learning - Combination of both supervised and unsupervised learning.

6) Training set: The training set is the most important subset of data because it is used to train the model. The model learns from the patterns in the data, 
and the quality of the training set determines the quality of the model.

Validation set: The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model during training and to select the best model. The purpose of the validation set 
is to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model learns to fit the training data too closely and performs poorly on new data.

Test set: The test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model after it has been trained and validated. The purpose of the test set is to provide an 
unbiased estimate of the model's performance on new, unseen data.

7) Supervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by treating the problem as a binary classification task, where the goal is to identify whether a given data 
point is an anomaly or not. In this approach, a labeled dataset is required, where each data point is labeled as either normal or anomalous.

8) Supervised Learning:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees


Unsupervised Learning:

K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
